# Blood Bank System

This is my final year project for a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and it was developed on 2014. Blood Bank System is a web application developed for blood searching and requesting. This system consists of three set of users, National Blood Centre management team usually from the IT department, Hospital staffs which is a doctor at the hospital, and a blood donor. Hospital that are interested to join into this system need to register their hospital by filling in online form about the information of the hospital and send it to the administrator to be approve by the National Blood Centre management team. After Blood Centre Management team approved the registration, hospital staffs of that hospital may use the system. Blood Donors who are willing to donate blood have to register in the system. While registering, the donors are requested to give their personal information and their medical details such as blood group.
When the hospital running out of specific blood type, Hospital staffs may login into the system and search which hospital that the blood type available to be given to them. Hospital staffs also may view all the blood that is available in the other hospital and National Blood Centre. Rather than view the available blood in other hospitals and National Blood Centre, Hospital staffs also can make a request for that blood directly through the system. Hospital staffs also can request blood from the blood donor. System will automatically analyse the list of donors who are suitable to donate according to the blood group and their location. 
Finally for the qualified and requested donors they will be informed through the system. When the blood donor login into the system they may see the request from the hospital to donate. The donor need to give response to that requested by choosing either he or she accept or reject it.
